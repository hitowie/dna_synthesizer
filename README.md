### "What does DNA sound like?"

In this fun project I'm playing around with nucleotide and amino acid sequences and make them play music.

#### Reference

This project is inspired by one of the final project ideas of the [2018 CSHL Programming for Biology course](https://github.com/prog4biol/pfb2018/blob/master/projects/Project%20Ideas.md#4-sound-idea).

Other examples of how to convert DNA or amino acid sequences into music can be found online, e.g. [DNA Sonification](http://dnasonification.org/), [2022 Smithonian article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-scientists-are-turning-molecules-into-music-180980022/).
